# PythonFinance
This is a project for Financial Analysis tools using Python, it's mainly focus on asset Valuation, trend analysis, and prediction.
With the usage of CFA and FRM knowledge, I am seeking to ease the process of preparing data set, mapping and plot into diagrams, and hopefully use formulas to avoid extreme loss.
